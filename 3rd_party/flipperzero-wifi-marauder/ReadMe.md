# WiFi Marauder companion app for Flipper Zero

Requires a connected dev board running Marauder FW. [See install instructions from UberGuidoZ here.](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Wifi_DevBoard#marauder-install-information)

## Get the app

The app is now released as a FAP for use with official firmware. Alternative firmwares manage their own releases and may come with the app preinstalled.

From a local clone of this repo, you can also build the app yourself using ufbt.
